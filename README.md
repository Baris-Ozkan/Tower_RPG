# Tower RPG

#### What will the application do?
The application is a RPG (Role Playing Game) that will allow the user to create a **hero** with various stats and use this **hero** to defeat the **monsters** of each level in a **tower** system where each following level is harder than the previous one and see how far they can go without being defeated. To aid the **hero**, levels can feature **items** that will support the **hero** in combat.
#### Why is this project of interest to you?
I'm interested in games and development and have always wanted to have my own project one day, so I thought I could make something simple for this term project that would have a close connection to me. RPGs are one of the oldest genre of games to date and their applications are so vast that they can manifest as a board game or a sheet of paper as well as a computer game. I thought making a simple RPG would help me understand the process of development and challenge myself to understand underlying systems of a game.
